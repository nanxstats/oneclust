## Introduction

The `oneclust` package implements the maximum homogeneity clustering
(partitioning) method for univariate data described in @fisher1958grouping
via dynamic programming. Given a one-dimensional numerical vector
$(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$, a weight vector $(w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n)$,
and a positive integer $k < n$, the algorithm seeks to minimize

$$
D = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} w_i (a_i - \bar{a_i})^2
$$

when each $a_i$ is assigned into $k$ clusters. $\bar{a_i}$ is the weighted mean
of the cluster that $a_i$ belongs to. Fisher proved that the optimal partitions
have to be _contiguous_. Contiguous means for $i < j < k$, if $a_i$ and $a_k$
are assigned to the same cluster, then $a_j$ must also be assigned to the
same cluster --- otherwise the partition would be suboptimal.
This fact leads to a substantially reduced number of possible partitions
and dynamic programming solutions.

Intuitively, maximum homogeneity clustering can be used to smooth the data
and reveal its structures. It has some potential applications in data
pre-processing and post-processing in statistical machine learning.

## Feature engineering for high-cardinality categorical features

Categorical features with high cardinality or rare levels pose a common
challenge when building certain types of supervised learning models.
For example, classification trees might only be able to handle
a limited number of levels in categorical predictors, because a binary node
split on a categorical feature with $l$ levels means finding one from $2^{l-1}$
possible combinations thus computationally intractable.

To tackle this problem, @breiman1984classification discussed splitting a
categorical feature into two subsets when the response is binary, and
generalized Fisher's result to arbitrary convex node impurity functions.
Lightgbm [@ke2017lightgbm]
[employs this method](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Features.html#optimal-split-for-categorical-features)
to find the optimal split by sorting the histogram based on the training
objective. As such, besides one-hot encoding and hashing, recoding
high-cardinality categorical features with histogram sorting and
maximum homogeneity partitioning could be a viable feature engineering
strategy in practice. The application is also not limited to tree models.

### Simulated postal code data

In this section, we simulate a high-cardinality variable with a binary response.
The key assumption here is: the probabilities of having which response correlate
to the size of the level.
After the data is generated, we use maximum homogeneity clustering on the
(sorted) histogram of the categorical variable. Our goal is to verify if
the clustering results can uncover this level size structure and potentially
help the classification modeling later. This example is derived from
the "rare levels" vignette in the `vtreat` package [@zumel2016vtreat].

```{r, message=FALSE}
library("oneclust")
```

Generate a training set and an independent test set:

```{r}
df_levels <- sim_postcode_levels(nlevels = 500, seed = 42)
train <- sim_postcode_samples(df_levels, n = 100000, threshold = 3000, prob = c(0.2, 0.1), seed = 43)
test <- sim_postcode_samples(df_levels, n = 100000, threshold = 3000, prob = c(0.2, 0.1), seed = 44)
```

The categorical variable has 500 (unique) levels of postal codes. The training
and test set each has 100,000 samples. The level size follows a log normal
distribution $LN(\log(4000), 1)$. For postal code levels with fewer than
3,000 samples, they are defined as "rare levels" and has a probability of 0.2
to get response label 1. Otherwise, the level has a probability of 0.1 of
getting response label 1. The rest of the samples will get a response label 0.

```{r}
head(df_levels)
head(train)
head(test)
```

### Recode the training set

For the training set, we cluster the postal codes into 32 clusters by
the size of each level (histogram):

```{r}
k <- 32
level_hist <- table(train$postcode)
level_new <- oneclust(level_hist, k)$cluster
feature_tr <- level_new[match(train$postcode, names(level_hist))] %>%
  as.character() %>%
  ordered(levels = as.character(1:k))
```

The postal codes belong to the first five clusters have a higher probability
(approximately 0.2) of getting label 1. The other clusters have a lower
probability (around 0.1) of getting label 1:

```{r}
op <- par(las = 1)
plot(feature_tr, train$label, lty = 0, xlab = "Cluster", ylab = "Label")
abline(h = 0.2, col = cud(1))
abline(h = 0.1, col = cud(2))
par(op)
```

We can also verify that the number of the samples in the first five clusters
is close to the actual number of samples in the "rare levels":

```{r}
sum(train$is_rare)
sum(table(feature_tr)[1:5])
```

When the specified number of clusters $k$ is smaller, the results might not
be as good though.

### Recode the test set

In practice, we should encode the postal codes in the test set with the same
cluster labels as we used in the training set, so that the classification models
can be correctly applied to the test set.

```{r}
feature_te <- level_new[match(test$postcode, names(level_hist))] %>%
  as.character() %>%
  ordered(levels = as.character(1:k))
```

Check if the recoded variable has the similar label pattern:

```{r}
op <- par(las = 1)
plot(feature_te, test$label, lty = 0, xlab = "Cluster", ylab = "Label")
abline(h = 0.2, col = cud(1))
abline(h = 0.1, col = cud(2))
par(op)
```

```{r}
sum(test$is_rare)
sum(table(feature_te)[1:5])
```

## Grouping coefficients in regression models

Besides sparsity and other properties, the _homogeneity_ of the estimated
coefficients in linear regressions is an important property ---
meaning certain groups of variables should be encouraged to share
the same coefficients [@ke2015homogeneity]. The source of homogeneity
could be attributed to the systematic similarities between variables,
for example, financial assets that belong to the same sector, or
sets of adjacent variables with strong spatial correlation [@lin2017ordered].

### Simulated regression data

We use an fused lasso regression model on simulated data to
illustrate the potential application in post-processing the coefficients.
The example is derived from the vignette in the
`genlasso` package [@tibshirani2011solution].

```{r}
set.seed(42)
n <- 100
i <- 1:n
y <- (i > 20 & i < 30) + 5 * (i > 50 & i < 70) + rnorm(n, sd = 0.1)
```

### Raw estimates

```{r}
genlasso_available <- requireNamespace("genlasso", quietly = TRUE)

out <- if (genlasso_available) {
  genlasso::fusedlasso1d(y)
} else {
  readRDS("out.rds")
}
```

```{r}
beta1 <- if (genlasso_available) {
  coef(out, lambda = 1.5)$beta
} else {
  readRDS("beta1.rds")
}
plot(beta1)
abline(h = 0)
```

### Soft-thresholding

We can use soft-thresholding to transform the raw coefficient estimates into
zero and non-zero values:

```{r}
beta2 <- if (genlasso_available) {
  genlasso::softthresh(out, lambda = 1.5, gamma = 1)
} else {
  readRDS("beta2.rds")
}
grp <- as.integer(beta2 != 0) + 1L
plot(beta2, col = cud(grp))
abline(h = 0)
legend("topleft", legend = c("Zero", "Non-zero"), col = cud(unique(grp)), pch = 1)
```

### Clustering (k = 2)

We can also use the maximum homogeneity clustering method to group
the coefficients into two clusters:

```{r}
cl1 <- oneclust(beta1, k = 2)$cluster
plot(beta1, col = cud(cl1))
abline(h = 0)
legend("topleft", legend = paste("Cluster", unique(cl1)), col = cud(unique(cl1)), pch = 1)
```

### Clustering (k = 3)

If needed, we can increase $k$ to get more groups of coefficients:

```{r}
cl2 <- oneclust(beta1, k = 3)$cluster
plot(beta1, col = cud(cl2))
abline(h = 0)
legend("topleft", legend = paste("Cluster", unique(cl2)), col = cud(unique(cl2)), pch = 1)
```

### Clustering while preserving data order (k = 5)

We sorted the data before clustering in all previous examples.
Since the data has a strong spatial correlation, we may need to
preserve the order of the data points when clustering them.
This was called the "restricted problem" in @fisher1958grouping.
To solve such problems, use `sort = FALSE`:

```{r}
cl3 <- oneclust(beta1, k = 5, sort = FALSE)$cluster
plot(beta1, col = cud(cl3))
abline(h = 0)
legend("topleft", legend = paste("Cluster", unique(cl3)), col = cud(unique(cl3)), pch = 1)
```

## Sequential data peak calling and segmentation

For sequential data such as time series data, the algorithm might be useful for peak calling and segmentation.

### Simulated time series data

We use an example from `pracma::findpeaks()`:

```{r}
x <- seq(0, 1, len = 1024)
pos <- c(0.1, 0.13, 0.15, 0.23, 0.25, 0.40, 0.44, 0.65, 0.76, 0.78, 0.81)
hgt <- c(4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 4.2, 2.1, 4.3, 3.1, 5.1, 4.2)
wdt <- c(0.005, 0.005, 0.006, 0.01, 0.01, 0.03, 0.01, 0.01, 0.005, 0.008, 0.005)

psignal <- numeric(length(x))
for (i in seq(along = pos)) {
  psignal <- psignal + hgt[i] / (1 + abs((x - pos[i]) / wdt[i]))^4
}

plot(psignal, type = "l")
```

### Peak calling (k = 2)

Group the signal into two clusters:

```{r}
cl <- oneclust(psignal, k = 2)
plot(psignal, type = "h", col = cud(cl$cluster))
legend("topright", legend = paste("Cluster", unique(cl$cluster)), col = cud(unique(cl$cluster)), lty = 1)
```

Cluster 2 covers the peak locations --- the method did not specify a single
data point as the peak, instead, it finds intervals.

### Peak calling (k = 4)

If we increase $k$, there will be fewer intervals included in the peak cluster
(Cluster 4), with narrower peak intervals:

```{r}
cl <- oneclust(psignal, k = 4)
plot(psignal, type = "h", col = cud(cl$cluster + 2))
legend("topright", legend = paste("Cluster", unique(cl$cluster)), col = cud(unique(cl$cluster + 2)), lty = 1)
```

One may also use the parameter `w` in `oneclust()` to use the weighted
version of the algorithm and amplify the signal.

### Segmentation (k = 6)

For segmentation, we should respect the order of the data:

```{r}
cl <- oneclust(psignal, k = 6, sort = FALSE)
plot(psignal, type = "h", col = cud(cl$cluster))
legend("topright", legend = paste("Cluster", unique(cl$cluster)), col = cud(unique(cl$cluster)), lty = 1, cex = 0.8)
```
